# The Coffee Shop (React Native App)

A React Native demonstration application that simulates a coffee shop ordering system. This project serves as both a functional app and a case study in legacy codebase analysis and modernization.

## üì± App Overview

The Coffee Shop app provides a complete customer journey from menu browsing to order pickup:

- **Menu Browsing**: View available coffee items with preparation times
- **Order Placement**: Tap items to add them to the preparation queue
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars show order preparation status
- **Order Pickup**: Collect completed orders from the pickup counter

### Current Features
- Three coffee items: Caf√© au lait (4s), Cappuccino (10s), Espresso (15s)
- Real-time order queue management with progress tracking
- Tab-based navigation with badge counts
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Responsive design with gradient styling

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Analysis

### What Worked Well
- **Functional Components**: Modern React patterns with hooks throughout
- **Context-Based State**: Simple but effective state management for this use case
- **Custom Hooks**: Well-implemented `useInterval` hook with proper cleanup
- **Navigation Structure**: Clean tab-based navigation with React Navigation 5
- **Visual Design**: Consistent coffee shop theming with thoughtful color palette

### Where It Aged Poorly
- **Type Safety**: Using Flow instead of TypeScript with loose typing
- **Performance**: Missing memoization causing unnecessary re-renders
- **Code Quality**: Inconsistent function declarations and missing error handling
- **Testing**: Minimal test coverage with only basic snapshot tests
- **Accessibility**: No accessibility support for screen readers

### How We'd Do It Today
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing with proper interfaces and generics
- **Performance Optimization**: React.memo, useMemo, and optimized FlatList
- **State Management**: Split contexts or Redux Toolkit for complex state
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries and proper logging

## üìä Code Quality Metrics

### Current State
- **Type Safety**: 0% (Flow with loose typing)
- **Test Coverage**: <5% (basic snapshot tests only)
- **Performance**: Moderate (missing optimizations)
- **Accessibility**: 0% (no accessibility support)
- **Error Handling**: Basic (try-catch blocks only)

### Target State (After Refactoring)
- **Type Safety**: 100% (strict TypeScript)
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ (comprehensive testing)

2. **Performance Optimization**: Add memoization and optimize FlatList
3. **Error Handling**: Implement error boundaries and proper logging
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Medium Priority
1. **State Management**: Split contexts or migrate to Redux Toolkit
2. **Accessibility**: Add screen reader support and accessibility props
3. **Code Quality**: Fix function declarations and add input validation
4. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments and component documentation

### Low Priority
1. **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting and tree shaking
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance tracking and monitoring
3. **Offline Support**: Implement offline-first architecture
4. **Analytics**: Add user behavior tracking
